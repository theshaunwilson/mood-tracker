# Mood Tracker

A simple app where users can

Log their mood for the day (with an emoji and optional note).
View their mood history as a colourful timeline.
See basic stats (most common mood this week).

This touches all the MERN essentials: Express API design, MongoDB schemas, React state management, and connecting it all together
